# Coffee Chain Product Launch: Finding the Ideal Test Market

## Project Summary

This capstone project represents the culmination of part one of my Springboard Data Analytics training, where I was tasked with transforming a dataset into a clear, actionable recommendation:

**Where should we launch our new product?**

The goal was to identify the best U.S. market to introduce **Peppermint Mocha Coffee Beans**, a seasonal coffee product, using financial and performance metrics across states, market types, and product lines.

## The Approach

This was more than an exploratory dashboard. It was a structured, hypothesis-driven analysis that asked:

- Which regions perform best in terms of profit and sales?
- What products resonate most with consumers—and where?
- Can we draw parallels between existing products and the one we’re planning to launch?
- What defines a market that’s ready for something new?

I used **Excel** for data cleaning and transformation and **Tableau** for visual analysis and storytelling. The project involved segmentation, profitability analysis, and comparative modeling across multiple dimensions.

## Key Insights

- **Ohio** emerged as the ideal test market:
  - Revenue: $8,787  
  - Share of Total Profit: 4.3%  
  - High popularity of coffee-related products, especially **Café Mocha**

- In Ohio, **Café Mocha** captured 17.5% of its total revenue share, making it a strong proxy for the potential success of **Peppermint Mocha Coffee Beans**.

- Ohio is a **Major** market with financial stability and proven consumer interest—an ideal environment for launching a new product.

## Tools and Techniques

- **Excel**: Data cleaning, aggregation, and metric calculations  
- **Tableau**: Visual exploration, dashboard creation, and storytelling  
- **Key methods**: Market segmentation, profit analysis, trend comparison, scenario filtering

## Why This Project Matters

This project reflects my core strength as a data analyst: the ability to bring order to chaos, ask the right questions, and tell compelling stories through data.

From hundreds of rows and dozens of variables, I arrived at a single recommendation—backed by evidence, supported by context, and packaged for decision-makers.
